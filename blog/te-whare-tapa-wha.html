      <h1>Te Whare Tapa Whā</h1>
      <p>
        Developed by Sir Mason Durie in 1984, Te Whare Tapa Whā is a Māori model
        of health and wellbeing. It is a metaphor based on four pillars of a
        wharenui/meeting house. When we look after all four aspects, we look
        after our hauora/wellbeing. Checking in on the four pillars helps us
        balance our hauora and support others to balance theirs, too. Below are
        some examples for supporting you and your whānau.
