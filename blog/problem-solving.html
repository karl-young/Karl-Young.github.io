      <h3>When I Was Blocked On A Simple Problem</h3>
      <h4>Manipulating Objects</h4>
      <p>
        I had difficulty manipulating objects in my coding tasks, specifically
        when I needed to use certain methods but didn't know which ones to
        choose or how to use them. I had to learn these methods as I went along
        to populate an array with names and terms.I used something called
        "console log" to figure out what was going on. I searched the internet
        for solutions to my problem. I also checked for errors and where they
        were coming from. And when I was really stuck, I asked my friends and
        coaches on Discord for help. At first, I felt pretty confused because I
        didn't know how to make the computer do what I wanted. I didnt know
        which methods to use But as I kept trying and making progress, I started
        to feel more confident. I found out that I need to learn more ways to
        understand these tests. After that, I'll have to go over them and
        practice a lot.

      <h3>A Time I Elegantly Solved A Problem</h3>
      <p>
        I felt like I did a good job with the "concatMyArray" test once I had
        solved the one before it, which used the "split" method which takes some
        words and splits off the part you select which worked perfectly for this
        one. At first, I Googled it, only to realize that I was overthinking it
        and just needed to use "split." This experience taught me that I
        sometimes make things more complicated than they need to be.

          really handy; it helps to know why something isn't working.

          see what's going on. Sometimes it doesn't work, so I need to get

          <span>Asking your peers or coaches for help:</span> I tend to try to
          figure it out on my own, but if I get stuck, I set a timer, and if I
          can't figure it out, I then ask for help.

        Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made
        you reluctant to do so. What might you try differently next time?
      </h3>
      <p>
        I had a tough time with the Fizzbuzz test, and I really wanted to prove
        to myself that I could solve it. When I got stuck, I kept turning to
        Google for help and trying different approaches, but nothing seemed to
        work. In the future, I plan to use my timer method; once the timer is
        up, I'll ask for help right away. I don't want to stay stuck on the same
        problem for too long.
