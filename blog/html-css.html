      When designing a web page, you may have various elements that require
      different styles. For example, you might want a group of paragraphs to
      feature large text, buttons to display medium-sized white text, and
      paragraphs to showcase small yellow text. Thankfully, CSS classes come to
      the rescue, allowing you to apply unique style properties to specific
      groups of HTML elements and achieve your desired web page appearance.
    </p>

    <p class="intro">
      Class selectors prove invaluable when you need to style multiple elements
      with similar characteristics. In your CSS file, you can then create a
      section dedicated to that class, where you can specify properties like
      font-family, font size, or text color to achieve consistent styling across
      all elements belonging to that class.<br />
      <br />
      For Example:
    </p>
    <section class="codeimg">
      <img src="../styles/Images/css-images/Classtext.png" alt="Classhtml" />
      <img src="../styles/Images/css-images/text.png" alt="textcss" />
    </section>

    <p class="intro">
      While a web page can contain multiple elements, each of these elements can
      be distinguished by a unique identifier called an 'ID.' It's important to
      note that each element is allowed to have only one ID, and within a given
      page, there should be only one element with that specific ID. This
      practice ensures the precise identification of elements and is a
      fundamental principle in web development for styling with CSS<br />
      <br />
      For Example:
    </p>
    <section class="codeimg">
      <img src="../styles/Images/css-images/Id.png" alt="Id" />
      <img src="../styles/Images/css-images/head.png" alt="Headers" />
    </section>
    <section class="sidebox">
      <ul class="box1 Wbox">
        <p>Classes are most commonly used for:</p>
        <li>Paragraphs</li>
        <li>Buttons</li>
        <li>Links</li>
      </ul>
      <ul class="box2 Wbox">
        <p>Id's are most commonly used for:</p>
        <li>Headers</li>
        <li>Footers</li>
        <li>Menus</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <div>
      <p class="intro">
        You can also employ them in combination. For instance, if you wish to
        utilize a common class for background color or style for your header
        while ensuring it differs from the class applied to other elements.
      </p>
    </div>
    <section class="codeimg">
      <img src="..//styles/Images/css-images/Class-and-id.png" alt="bothhtml" />
      <img src="../styles/Images/css-images/bothcss.png" alt="css" />
    </section>
    <p class="intro">
      A metaphor that can be employed is the process of attending school and
      obtaining a student ID. Just as there can only be one unique student ID
      per person, you'd ideally like to attend multiple classes. Hence you can
      onl;y have one Id but many classes.
