      <div class="intro">
        <p>
          My long term goal would be to live financially free, but thats a while
          away. For now i would like to get experience possibly working for a
          company or starting something of my own. I'm unsure what kind of
          career i would be interested in, but I'm optimistic that this course
          will help me discover it.

        <p>
          <span>Pre-Bootcamp:</span> I dont really have a destination in mind im
          in this course to learn new skills and find out more about myself
          which in the long run will help me figure things out.
