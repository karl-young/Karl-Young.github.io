        Hi my name is karl and i have difficulty talking about myself. Ive
        always been an interverted person and i find interacting with others
        stressful. This is not because i dont like people i just never know what
        to say. Although i do like talking to people that i know really well. Im
        the kind of person that has few friends but long term friends. I have
        discovered that it is equally difficult to pin point my strenghts and
        weakness using online tests because i feel they don't accurately
        discribe who i am. Eg; i had to choose from a series of word
        associations that inclueded personility traits i do not have. Therefore
        i would like to describe myself using an example of something that
        happend this morning...
      </p>
      <p class="intro">
        My partener has always described me as a level headed, generous person,
        contrasted against her firery, hotheaded personality. A perfect example
        would have been this morning. She got up early because she had to catch
        the bus for an appointment, as she doesn't drive. I being busy with
        classes was unable to take her to her appointment as i like to drive and
        often offer her a ride to her destinations. She decided to minimize the
        ammount of things she wanted to carry in her bag, and took out her cards
        and cash. She descovered that her bank card was missing and immedliately
        flew into a panic. She went through every pocket of all her pants,
        jackets and lanudry hanging on the line, just in case she accidently
        washed it. All this with only a few minutes to catch the bus. I told her
        not to panic and offered her my bank card so she could pay for her
        appointment and told her i would help her look for her card when she
        came back home. She was stressed, anxious and began talking about all
        the things she had to do in order to cancel her card. She also began to
        think back to all the places she could have lost it. Once again i tried
        to calm her by saying, "we can contact all the places we have been in
        the last week, you dont need to panic it will be fine. Please just take
        my card". Seconds to spare before the bus would completely miss her and
        she unable to concentrate on catching the bus, i decided to take her to
        her appointment which would give her more time to look for her card
        without having to rush. Now that she was calm, she carefully went
        through her jackets again and found the card. She thanked me for my help
        and i took her to her appointment and everything worked out in the end.
      </p>
      <p class="intro">
        So, in conclusion i feel this story best describes me. "Calm under
        pressure", "rational", "able to problem solve" and "helpful". At least
        thats what my partner says, Because i dont like talking about myself.
        Looking back on it now i don't think there was anything i would change i
        missed a small part of study to make sure my partner was fine.

      <p class="intro">
        I have come to realize that, i have very little difficulty with figuring
        out how mechanical objects work. Those kind of things come natural for
        me. Ive built many of my old computers and even learnt how to liquid
        cool my latest one. I also have an old Triumph car that i work on. When
        i first got it the engine didnt run, it didn't reverse and it had no
        lights. In a short time i've got it running again, i put new lights in
        and have fixed the reverse. I am figuring out what it needs to get back
        on the road. I enjoy figuring it out and look forward to the day i can
        take it on the road. I am enjoying the learning process and i am picking
        things up quickly. It has been an intregral part of my hobbies. I have
        always had a love of cars since my grandad introduced me to their
        projects. I have fond memories of him working on his cars which inspired
        me to work on mine.

      <p class="intro">
        I use to work at Countdown for a total of eleven years. I was used to a
        certain structure which encouraged a high level of standards. In my last
        year of working there, i got a new manager and she did things
        differently. I was meticulous about keeping up with the former
        standards. Maintaining a quality of produce that I could take pride in.
        But, as time passed, i noticed that her idea of "good" differed from
        mine, which made it complicated to work there. I tried to disscuss it
        with her, but nothing i said or did convinced her of my experiences and
        what was best for the customers.
      </p>
      <p class="intro">
        In the end, i just continued with what i was doing and left her to her
        devices. I had good days and bad days in regards to work quality.
        Reflecting on it now, i dont think i could of changed her mind, and that
        leaving that job to persue better options and oppertunities, was the
        best thing I have ever done. Now I can focus on broading my mind and
        work skill in a non hostal enviroment, and have fun doing it.
