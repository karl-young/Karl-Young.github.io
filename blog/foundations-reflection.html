        What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego
        due to the core learning?
      </h2>
      <p>
        I have learned that I do have an ego, and it doesn't like to be
        embarrassed, which I am finding is affecting my level of confidence.
        This, in turn, affects my communication skills. I need to reach out and
        ask for help more often instead of just sitting there trying to figure
        it out by myself. I've also learned that this course has helped me
        understand my drawbacks and how to overcome them.

        What are the roles of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning
        and programming?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Values, empathy, and self-awareness play large roles in learning and
        programming, influencing not only how you approach technical challenges
        but also how you collaborate with others. Your values help you determine
        what is right and wrong when faced with complicated choices. Empathy is
        essential in working with teams, in client interactions, and in
        recognizing and addressing the diverse needs and backgrounds of users.
        Self-awareness can help you understand how you learn, what areas you can
        excel at, and which you may need improvement in. Understanding your
        communication style can also help you work with others.

      <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
      <p>
        What suprised me, was how much help i needed and how difficult it was to
        ask for that help.

      <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
      <p>
        Figuring out what to say and how to say it was a challenge for me when
        working on my Identity, values, and strengths blog. Some of those
        personality tests posed questions I couldn't answer definitively but
        still had to select an option. For example, in the Dope Bird Test, there
        was a question asking, 'Which one of these are you: Hotheaded, Vengeful,
        Rash, or Fearful?' I found it difficult to describe myself with any of
        those traits, and many of the tests had similar questions. As a result,
        I ended up writing a story about an experience that had happened to me
        that day in the hopes that it would convey my points effectively.

        Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
        focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Learning core helps us to understand and work with lots of different
        people. On an emotional as well as professional level. We learn about
        ourselves and what makes us tick, Its not enough to just code. it is
        important to interact with others to expand our understanding of making
        something with a soul. To touch the lives of people and encourage them
        to create through feelings of joy.

        Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of
        time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming
        instead? Justify your answer.
      </h2>
      <p>
        It doesn't feel like a waste of time. Yes, I could have used more time
        to practice programming, but the core part of this study will also help
        me work with other people. When you're working with others in a team or
        something, you want to understand where they are coming from. This core
        learning is about you and others working together and reaching an
        understanding of each other
