      <h3>JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS</h3>

      <p>
        Javascript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is
        used practictly everywhere on the web along side HTML and CSS. Together
        they create interactive and visually appealing websites. You can use it
        to animate images, control multimedia, update items as you go and a lot
        more. it can do some amazing things.

          HTML is like the noun of web development. It serves as the structural
          foundation, defining the elements and content of your web page. HTML
          tells you what's on the page, like headings, paragraphs, images, and
          links.

          JavaScript is the action or verb. It adds functionality and
          interactivity to your web page. With JavaScript, you can make your web
          page elements "do stuff" like responding to user clicks, displaying
          dynamic content, and communicating with servers to fetch data.

          CSS is akin to the adjective. It enhances the appearance and style of
          your web page elements, making them look visually appealing. CSS can
          control colors, fonts, spacing, and layout, transforming your web page
          from plain and functional (HTML) into something aesthetically pleasing
          and engaging. It's what makes your "things and stuff" look nice.

      <h3>Control flow and loops, arrays, and objects</h3>
      <p>
        Control flow is like a roadmap for a program, deciding which actions or
        instructions to execute next based on various conditions and decisions
        made during program execution. It is commonly influenced by conditions,
        loops, and branching statements, which guide the direction a program
        follows depending on specific criteria or input from the user.<br />
        In JavaScript loops are used to repeat actions based on a condition.
        There are different types like "for", "while", and "do-while" loops.
        They help automate tasks and process data efficiently in JavaScript
        programs or webpages.<br />
        In JavaScript, an array is like a list that can hold multiple items,
        such as numbers, text, or objects. You can access the items by counting
        the number of items but starting at 0 not 1. They are created using
        square brackets, like this: let myArray = [0, 1, 2];<br />An object is
        like a container with labeled compartments, and each compartment can
        hold different pieces of information. It's a way to organize and store
        related data together. For example, think of a person. You can describe
        a person using various properties, like their name, age, height, weight,
        and eye colour. In JavaScript, you can create an object to represent
        this person.

        <h3>The difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h3>
        <p>
          Accessing data from arrays is like getting items from a numbered list,
          where you use numbers to pick items in order. In contrast, accessing
          data from objects is like finding things in a labeled box, where you
          use labels (property names) to get what you need. Arrays use numbers,
          while objects use labels to access their data.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="intro">
        <h3>Functions and why they are useful</h3>
        <p>
          A function in JavaScript is like a recipe. It's a reusable set of
          instructions that you can use to perform a specific task or
          calculation in your code. You give it some input (if needed), it does
          its thing, and then it gives you an output. Functions help keep your
          code organized and make it easier to use the same set of instructions
          in different parts of your program.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h3>The DOM</h3>
      <p>
        The DOM (Document Object Model) is like a tool that helps you interact
        with objects within an HTML document. Think of it as a structure that
        organizes everything on a web page, and it's a bit like a family tree
        with one main parent.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you want to do things with specific parts of a webpage, you can
        think of those parts in different ways. You can think of them by their
        type like, paragraphs or boxes, by their name like, "container", or by
        giving them a special name like, "box1".
      </p>
      <p>
        To actually do things with these parts, you use a computer language
        called JavaScript. It's like telling the computer what to do with those
        parts of the webpage. For example, if you want to find and do something
        with the first part that has the special name 'bloglinks,' you tell the
        computer to look for it using a special code called
        document.querySelector('#bloglinks').
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want to do something with several parts that are all called
        'dom,' you use another special code called
        document.querySelectorAll('.box1'). This way, you can tell the computer
        to find and work with all the parts that share that special name 'box1'
        on the webpage.

      <h3>DevTools</h3>
      <p>
        DevTools, short for Developer Tools, is a helpful toolkit built into web
        browsers. It's like a special set of tools for web detectives. With
        DevTools, you can investigate how websites are put together, find and
        fix issues, and even make changes to web pages in real-time. It's like
        having blueprint for the websites, allowing you to peek behind the
        scenes and tinker with things if you need to. So, if you ever wonder how
        a webpage works or want to debug problems, DevTools got your back.
