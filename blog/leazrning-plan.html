      <p class="intro">
        My long term goal would be to live financially free, but thats a while
        away. For now i would like to get experience possibly working for a
        company or starting something of my own. I'm unsure what kind of career
        i would be interested in, but I'm optimistic that this course will help
        me discover it.
